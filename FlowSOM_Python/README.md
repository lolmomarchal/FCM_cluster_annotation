The complete FlowSOM package known from R, now available in Python

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][link-docs]. In particular, the

-   [API documentation][link-api].

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.9 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

There are several alternative options to install FlowSOM:

<!--
1) Install the latest release of `FlowSOM` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/FlowSOM/>`_:

```bash
pip install FlowSOM
```
-->

1. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/saeyslab/FlowSOM_Python
```

## Usage

Starting from an FCS file that is properly transformed, compensated and checked for quality, the following code can be used to run the FlowSOM algorithm:

```python
# Import the FlowSOM package
import flowsom as fs

# Load the FCS file
ff = fs.io.read_FCS("./tests/data/ff.fcs")

# Run the FlowSOM algorithm
fsom = fs.FlowSOM(
    ff, cols_to_use=[8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], xdim=10, ydim=10, n_clus=10
)

# Plot the FlowSOM results
p = fs.pl.plot_stars(fsom, background_values=fsom.get_cluster_data().obs.metaclustering)
p.show()
```
